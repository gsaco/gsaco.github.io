I’m currently diving deep into Economics at Universidad del Pacífico, where I specialize in Machine Learning applied to business. My goal? To optimize decision-making through predictive analytics! I’m in my seventh semester and thrilled to be ranked in the top 20% of my program—plus, I've scored a perfect 20 in all my Machine Learning courses so far. I’ve even conducted some eye-opening data-driven econometric research on everything from labor markets to consumer behavior and industry competition in Peru. 

On top of that, I’m also studying Economics and Finance at the University of London under the amazing guidance of the London School of Economics (which, by the way, is ranked 7th in the world for Economics). I was handpicked for this dual degree program out of over 900 students at Universidad del Pacífico, thanks to my academic excellence and stellar interview skills. I’m on track to earn First Class Honours, which is like hitting the academic jackpot. I’m all about mastering economics and statistics, and I’ve taken cool courses in Communication and Influence, Leadership, and Creative Transformation 🌍.

💼 Consulting Passion Now, let’s talk about my true love: consulting! Right now, I’m rocking the role of Analytics Consultant at 180 Degrees Consulting, the largest consultancy for social organizations in the world. I get to collaborate with an awesome team of six, and together, we’re all about boosting operational efficiency and scalability for Practimatch, an AI-powered startup that connects interns with companies. I’ve automated three crucial workflows using Python, saving our client over 100 hours a month! That’s not just impressive—it’s a total game changer for their operations.

And here’s the best part: I’m receiving top-notch training from consulting giants like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company, and APOYO Consultoría. This means I’m learning from the best of the best to level up our project’s consulting frameworks! My time in consulting has taught me how to be creative and analytical when tackling tough business challenges, and it fuels my passion to create innovative solutions that really make a difference 🧠.
